### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

 Lab 9, part 1 was honestly the first time I was truly stuck on what to do in a lab. This one was thoroughly difficult and I found that to be the most fun about it. Having to think hard about what to do and how to solve the issues that we were having was really fun and left me excited for the next one.

* Lab 4

Lab 4, part 1 was what I say was my real introduction in C++. Though the idea and code of the High Low game was simple, it was my first step into the world of C++ coding. For that reason I really enjoyed this lab.

* Lab 8

Lab 8, part 1 was fun since I had no idea how scoring works in the olympics. Sports have always been something that I spend a lot of time watching and interacting with, so knowing a little more about it is always something I will enjoy. Another thing is that it gave me a real world application on how CS can be used in the real world, and more importantly in the things that I love.
